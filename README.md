# Code Refactor Starter Code

In this challenge we were generally asked to review a source code for ways to better organize, read, and construct the code in the HTML and consolidate, organize, and improve the CSS.  Below is a list of some of the changes made.

Summary of Changes:
- Generally improved the organization of the code and CSS. i.e. used proper indintation and moved CSS elements into logical groups.
- Changed title to "Horiseion - Web Optimization".
- Changed section titles to better describle the content. i.e. added a header, aside, and Nav section in place of div.
- Added <alt> descriptions to images. This include using "aria-label" for an image source in the CSS.
- Combined individual classes into a single class to simplify common CSS styling.
- Added some <Br> to match flow of mockup text wrapping.
